Data compression module: compress the selling posts

Logging module: would help us with debugging

Data Encryption Module:  encrypt the credit card information and the posts? and also the bids? 

Authentication Module: authenticate if the session hasn't expired (for example taking too long to confirm a sell might lead to need to log into the account again)

Sorting Module: Sort the posts by price? 

Configuration Management Module: this would be to save the preferences of a user i think (like keeping track of wether he uses dark/light mode and other specific options to them) Any ideas how this would be of help to us (maybe their credit card information)?

Caching module: might be useful to quickly get the price when an auction is going on

internationalization module: don't know, maybe automatically convert from ron tu eur? any ideas?

feature toggle module: might be useful if the seller can for exemple toggle on and off a minimum bid price?

basic data validation module: would be great to check if the numbers are valid(written correctly), positive and sanitize the validity of the description of the product?
